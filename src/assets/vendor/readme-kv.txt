This folder contains primarily the templateing system's vendors that are mainly front end 
javascript type components. I seperated out php based components into the /_php/ folder. 

I have added the following folders:

/_php
/_php/phpmailer-5.2.4

/icon-awesome-5 (stopped using their provided older version /icon-awesome/)
/revslider-standalone
/sky-forms-2.0.5


*I may have added some of the jquery stuff. Keep this in mind if you have to move
to newer version of template.
